# 437 Machine Learning Project
 Utilizing an electricity usage dataset combined with weather data in order to predict electricity usage.

Datasets has the merged file that should be used in the python notebook along with the original datasets that are used within the provided Rmd file to clean and merge the two datasets. These two original datasets were too large to be uploaded directly to Github, so instead there is a .txt file with a link to the google drive they are stored in.

Code includes both the .Rmd file along with the python notebook

Documentation includes the powerpoint, the demo videos, along with the various documentation files
